Data corrections
----------------

General (not pipeline-specific) data corrections were designed in ParSeq for
the amendment of data distortions. One example of data correction is the
removal of diffraction peaks arriving at a fluorescence detector during x-ray
absorption measurements. In this case, diffraction peaks may appear as sharp
artefacts seen by different detector channels at different x-ray energies. The
correction can be a simple deletion of a few data points or a replacement by a
spline segment, where the comparison with undistorted spectra can guide the
decisions.

The ParSeq corrections operate in a transformation node and are applied to all
data arrays defined in that node. The corrections are calculated following the
incoming transformations that lead to the node.

.. note::
   When setting up a correction that depends on y-coordinates (e,g. spline
   correction) in the ParSeq GUI, make sure that the plot widget does not
   apply a normalization or any other modification affecting the y-axis.

In the present version, only 1D nodes can receive corrections. Each correction
defines a dictionary of parameters. The following corrections are defined.

+------------------+------------------+
|    correction    |    description   |
+==================+==================+
|  delete region   | |text_del|       |
+------------------+------------------+
|  scale region    | |text_scl|       |
+------------------+------------------+
| replace region   |                  |
| by spline        | |text_spl|       |
+------------------+------------------+
| delete spikes    | |text_spk|       |
+------------------+------------------+
| remove data step | |text_stp|       |
+------------------+------------------+

.. |text_del| replace::
   (*lim*: 2-sequence)
   All points within the (lim[0], lim[1]) interval are deleted from the node
   arrays.

.. |text_scl| replace::
   (*lim*: 2-sequence, *scale*: float)
   All points within the (lim[0], lim[1]) interval are vertically scaled toward
   the straight line connecting the end data points that fall within the
   interval. The scaling factor depends on the vertical distance from the
   `scale` parameter to the straight line.

.. |text_spl| replace::
   (*lim*: 2-sequence, *knots*: list of 2-lists ((x, y) points))
   A spline drawn through the given knots replaces the points within the
   (lim[0], lim[1]) interval.

.. |text_spk| replace::
   (*lim*: 2-sequence, *cutoff*: float)
   The first y-array defined in the node is used to calculate its second
   difference. The second difference is normalized to its maximum and compared
   with `cutoff`. The exciding points are deleted from the node arrays.
   The automatic cutoff is set as 0.7.

.. |text_stp| replace::
   (*left*: float (x-coordinate), *right*: 2-sequence ((x, y) point))
   All data points to the right of the `right` point are shifted vertically by
   the height difference at the `right` point. The points within the interval
   from left to right are linearly shifted from zero at the left to the found
   constant shift at the right.
