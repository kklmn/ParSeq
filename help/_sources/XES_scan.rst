   :bigger:`A pipeline for data processing of XES theta scans`


A pipeline for data processing of XES theta scans, where the crystal (here only
one) is scanned in its theta angle and the analyzed emission is collected by a
2D detector.

This pipeline also serves as an example for creating analysis nodes, transforms
that connect these nodes and widgets that set options and parameters of the
transforms.
